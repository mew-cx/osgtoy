This is a package of prebuilt 3rd party dependency libraries for use
with the OpenSceneGraph http://openscenegraph.org/

These binaries were built using on Microsoft WindowsXP SP2 using
Visual Studio 2005 (8.0) SP1, with minimal modifications to the
makefiles/projectfiles for consistent use of the "multi-threaded DLL"
(i.e.: /MD and /MDd) versions of the Visual Studio runtime libraries.

NOTE: You must have Visual Studio 2005 Service Pack 1 installed to use
these prebuilt binaries.

The list of exact upstream source packages can be found in the
src\PACKAGE_VERSIONS.bat script.
