README_3rdParty.txt - Mike Weiblen http://mew.cx/ 2007-06-21

This is a package of prebuilt 3rd party dependency libraries for use with
the OpenSceneGraph http://openscenegraph.org/

These binaries were built using Microsoft VisualStudio 8.0 2005 SP1,
with minimal modifications to the makefiles/projectfiles for consistent use
of the "multi-threaded DLL" (ie /MD and /MDd) versions of the VisualStudio
C++ runtime libraries.

A list of the exact upstream source archives can be found in the
src\GET_SOURCES.bat script.

Other 3rd party prebuilt binaries of interest to OSG developers:
