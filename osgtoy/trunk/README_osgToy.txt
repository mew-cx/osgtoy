My laboratory for OpenSceneGraph experimentation and prototyping,
osgToy is a collection of experimental/whimsical/maybe-useful code and data.
It is, by defintion, always under development and may change dramatically.
Have fun but use at your own risk.

The osgtoy project is hosted at http://sourceforge.net/projects/osgtoy/

See the individual components for their licensing; some are under the
OpenSceneGraph Public License, some are under the 3Dlabs BSD-style license.

Launch RUN_osgToy.bat for a demo of some of the toys.
Notice the only app used is osgviewer.
Try experimenting with the commandline arguments.

While core functionality is implemented in the osgToy library and available to
apps via the API, many toys also provide a pseudoloader and so may be used
with any OSG app simply via the usual commandline filename interface.
