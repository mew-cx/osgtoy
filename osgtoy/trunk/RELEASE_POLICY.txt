Regarding the release policy of "Toys for the OpenSceneGraph" at
http://sourceforge.net/projects/osgtoy/ ...

I have occasionally created release packages of osgtoy, but I will rarely
do that anymore.  Being an experimental hodgepodge of projects,
osgtoy simply doesn't lend itself to a formally packaged release model.

Instead, the latest stuff will be found in the CVS repository,
which you may browse at http://osgtoy.cvs.sourceforge.net/osgtoy/

I will continue creating packaged releases of 3rdParty dependencies,
since those do lend themselves to that packaging model.

Cheers
