
overlay an XYZ axis object on the rendered scene

orientation of axis could be attached to anything,
but initial use is to attach to camera|manipulator orientation.

need to specify where on screen to render, and what size
(basically viewport-type parameters)


axis could be a simple wire triad created by code, with
optional loading of a model file.


toggle to enable/disable rendering of of the axis model

optional contrasting color background|frame|border

===========================================================================

similarly, an overlay "plan-view display" (PVD):

basically an axis-aligned wireframe quad to put a cursor, for very simple
positional awareness.

API to set range of the quad, and which axes the quad maps to.

could optionally be instanced multiple times, so an app could decide to
display all axis orientations (xy, xz, yz) at the same time

The PVD could be a wireframe of the extent volume, or perhaps an orthographic
render of the actual main scene (world in miniature)

optional contrasting color background|frame|border

===========================================================================
Use RenderBin or postdraw callback?
How does osghud, on-screen help, osgdb_logo do it?

intended primarily for attaching these to a cameraview|viewmanipulator

(BTW, is this connection related to the osgVRPN view manipulator?)
