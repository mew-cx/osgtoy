Hello,

Somebody (McKay Davis) asked me some time ago about a small tool I made
to generate a Graphviz .dot file from a scenegraph. This tool allows you
to generate a picture of node and drawable relationships (and some other
stuff as well) for a given model file readable by OSG. I hereby post
this tool to the list. I don't have time nor any work relation a.t.m.
with OSG to make it into something more advanced. The code is in the
public domain, so if this is deemed interesting enough it could be included
in the OSG distribution.

I've succesfully used it on some projects to gain insight into the contents 
of OSG files. Mostly to verify output written by other tools  
and to check how the 3D Studio MAX exporter writes a scene.
It should work on small and large models (in number of nodes) as the 
limiting factor is most likely the dot tool, which has to layout the graph 
nodes to generate the actual picture. Attached are example output when run 
on the cessnafire.osg model distributed with OSG and for a model exported 
from 3D Studio MAX. See the source for the meaning of the grey color, line 
thickness, etc.

It consists of only a single C++ file. There's some comments on how to
use it and what it outputs, at the beginning of the file. You need the
graphviz package to convert the .dot file to a PNG or JPEG. And lastly,
it's pretty primitive at the moment, so a lot of things could be added.

Have fun with it,
Paul
