README.txt for OpenSceneGraph win32 installer
Mike Weiblen - http://mew.cx/  mew-AT-mew-DOT-cx

This is a full-featured runtime package of OpenSceneGraph binaries, 3rdParty
dependency libraries, sample data, plus several additional extensions beyond
the core OSG.

It was built using Microsoft VisualStudio v8.0 SP1 on WindowsXP SP2.
To keep this installer compact, only Release binaries are included.

The OSG website is http://www.openscenegraph.org/

The verbatim source tree used to create these binaries is in osgsrc.zip.

Please do not ask the OSG developers for support of this installer or its
contents, as this package is not their doing.
