This is a full-featured runtime package of OpenSceneGraph binaries, 3rdParty
dependency libraries, sample data, plus several additional extensions beyond
the core OSG.

It was built using Microsoft VisualStudio v8.0 SP1 on WindowsXP SP2.
To keep this installer compact, only Release binaries are included.

The OSG website is http://www.openscenegraph.org/

The verbatim source tree used to create these binaries is in osgsrc.zip.
(NOTE: osgsrc.zip is intentionally blank for this beta build)

The packaging tools used to build this installer are available from:
https://osgtoy.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/osgtoy/osgbuilds/branches/

The 3rdParty dependency libraries are available from:
https://osgtoy.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/osgtoy/3rdParty/branches/3rdParty_win32binaries_vs80sp1

Please do not ask the OSG developers for support of this installer or its
contents, as this package is not their doing.
